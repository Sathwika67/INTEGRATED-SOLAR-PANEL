# INTEGRATED-SOLAR-PANEL
A suntracking solar panel system adjusts its orientation to maximize sunlight absorption throughout the day. Integrated rain sensors detect precipitation, triggering an automatic wiper to keep the panels clean and efficient. This combination optimizes energy production while maintaining panel performance in varying weather conditions.
