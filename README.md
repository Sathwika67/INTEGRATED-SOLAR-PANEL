# INTEGRATED-SOLAR-PANEL
This project presents the design and implementation of an intelligent sun-tracking solar panel system equipped with a rain sensor and automated wiper mechanism. The primary objective is to maximize solar energy capture while ensuring the cleanliness and longevity of the solar panels. The system employs a dual-axis tracking mechanism that adjusts the panel's orientation to follow the sun's path, optimizing the angle of incidence and increasing energy efficiency. A rain sensor detects precipitation and activates a wiper system to remove water, dirt, and debris from the panel surface, maintaining optimal performance and reducing maintenance efforts. The integration of these components ensures continuous and efficient energy generation, even in adverse weather conditions, and extends the operational life of the solar panels. The system is controlled by a microcontroller, which processes data from light sensors, the rain sensor, and motor encoders to achieve precise tracking and cleaning operations. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in energy output compared to stationary panels, showcasing the system's effectiveness and reliability.
